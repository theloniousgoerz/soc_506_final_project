# soc_506_final_project
Final statistical project and poster for SOC 506/CS&amp;SS 507 at UW. 
In this project, I will analyze attitudes about school sex education using the General Social Survey (GSS) and the GSSR package.

I use logistic regression and employ a model testing strategy using a confusion matric, likelihood ratio tests, and AIC and BIC measures.
